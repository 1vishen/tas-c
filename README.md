# tas-c 🗂️ : Java Terminal-Based Task Manager & Learning Project

This started as a simple terminal-based task manager, but it’s really just my playground to try out and apply everything I learn in Java.  
Whenever I pick up a new concept—whether it’s file handling, JDBC, anonymous functions, or threads—I add it here and experiment with it in a real project.  
So yeah, it’s part app, part coding practice, all in one.
